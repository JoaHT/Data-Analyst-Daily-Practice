# Day 3 â€“ CASE Statements for Categorization

**Focus:** Using CASE to group countries by threat level.

**Goal:** Categorize yearly incident totals as Low, Medium, or High Threat.

**Key Learnings:**
- `CASE` statements make results more interpretable for business analysis.
- Thresholds (e.g., >=40 = High) help translate numbers into actionable insights.

**Insight:**
> The majority of countries fall within the Medium Threat category, with incident totals generally in the 30s.  
> This indicates a moderate but steady level of cybersecurity activity globally.
