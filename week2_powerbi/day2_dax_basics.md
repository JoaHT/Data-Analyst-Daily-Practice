# Day 2 – DAX Basics: CALCULATE(), FILTER(), ALL()

**Focus:** Practicing DAX context control functions to shape analysis.

### Key Measures
- `Total Incidents France`
- `High Incident Countries`
- `% of Total Incidents`
- `Post-2020 % of Total`

### Key Learnings
- `CALCULATE()` changes the *filter context*.
- `FILTER()` refines which rows are evaluated dynamically.
- `ALL()` resets filters, allowing comparisons against the total.
- Understanding context transition is fundamental to advanced DAX.

**Next Step (Day 3):**
Add interactivity — KPI cards, drill-through pages, and user-friendly storytelling features.
