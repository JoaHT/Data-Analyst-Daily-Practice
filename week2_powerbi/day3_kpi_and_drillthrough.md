# Day 3 – KPI Cards & Drill-Throughs

**Focus:** Enhancing interactivity and storytelling with dynamic KPIs and drill-through logic.

## KPI Cards
- Total Incidents
- Avg Incidents per Country
- % of Total Incidents
- High Incident Status (conditional formatting)

## Drill-Through
- Created ‘Country Details’ page
- Linked by dim_country[Country]
- Added trend charts and summary cards
- Dynamic title shows selected country

## Interactivity
- Slicers for Year and Country with Sync enabled
- Page navigation buttons for user flow

**Key Takeaway:**  
Power BI interactivity turns static data into a narrative — users can move seamlessly from overview to insight without losing context.

**Next Step (Day 4):**  
Time Intelligence – apply DATEADD(), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), and rolling metrics.
